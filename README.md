## Installation 
In order to run the app you must clone the starter code. You will then need to run dependencies on both the client and server
folder. You will run npm i and then you will run npm start. This will then run your app in your localhost. You will also need
to deploy this app with heroku. Here is my heroku URL https://git.heroku.com/pwa-txteditor.git

## Tests
This app can be tested in your localhost.
